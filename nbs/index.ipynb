    "Cryptotree is an open-source package to allow the Decision Trees and Random Forests to be used on encrypted data, using the homomorphic encryption library [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL), and its Python wrapper [SEAL-python](https://github.com/Huelse/SEAL-Python). Cryptotree leverages the recent encryption scheme [CKKS](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf), which is implemented in SEAL, to perform homomorphic computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the fact that Random Forests can be modeled by [Neural Random Forests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07143.pdf) (2016, Biau, Scornet & Welbl), cryptotree proposes an homomorphic evaluation of these Neural Networks in a SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) manner, in order to do homomorphic evaluation of Homomorphic Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptotree therefore both implements Neural Random Forests, and Homomorphic Random Forests, and allows the use of powerful supervised models on encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptotree is developped using [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/), which allows to develop efficiently in Jupyter notebooks. The code is therefore available in the folder <code>nbs/</code>, and has been structured to be heavily documented with examples for a better understanding of cryptotree."
