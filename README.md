> Cryptotree is an implementation of Neural Decision Trees (NDT), and Homomorphic Decision Trees (HDT), which enable users to convert their Scikit-learn trees to NDT, then to HDT.


## Install

`pip install your_project_name`

## How to use

Fill me in please! Don't forget code examples:

## TODO

- Implement Baby step, Giant step for polynomial evaluation
- Find a way to fine tune the comparator and the matcher of the neural decision trees, while preserving the invariant which is having an output in $[-1,1]$
